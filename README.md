# Mineralogy 6 for Minecraft 1.13.2

Mineralogy adds real-world rock families, matching construction blocks,
mineral ores and dusts, rock furnaces, drywall, rock-salt lighting, fertilizer,
and crude oil. OreSpawn 4 is the sole terrain, strata, ore, and deposit engine;
Mineralogy no longer installs a parallel world generator.

This branch builds Mineralogy `6.0.1.113021` for Forge `25.0.223` and requires
OreSpawn `4.0.6` or another compatible 4.x release. Install both mods on clients
and servers.

## Configuration and help

Mineralogy's content and recipe switches remain in
`config/mineralogy-common.toml`. Use OreSpawn's world-creation UI or saved world
profile for rock, ore, fluid, dimension, altitude, and terrain-host settings.
Generation changes apply to new chunks only.

After the first start, the complete human guide is available under
`config/mineralogy-guide/`. The maintained source is in [docs](docs/README.md)
and covers upgrades, content controls, pack overrides, provider data, and
four-component release versions.

## Compatibility

The `mineralogy` mod ID and historical block, item, tile, NBT, recipe, asset,
patch, and pre-flattening world-conversion identities are retained. Existing
Mineralogy 5 configuration is read without being rewritten. Established worlds
continue through OreSpawn's migrated Cyano/geome profile unless their owner
explicitly selects a different engine.
